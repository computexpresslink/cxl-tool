All changes made on ndctl code repo to generate cxl-tool are listed here.
1. removing directory ndctl and daxctl.
2. removing all ndctl and dax related tests in directory `test`, and
only four tests are left afterwards: cxl-create-region.sh, cxl-labels.sh
cxl-region-sysfs.sh and cxl-topology.sh.
3. cxl-labels.sh relies on ndctl command to find nmem devices corresponding to
cxl memdevs, since ndctl has been removed from the repo, we try to locate ndctl
in case the ndctl package is installed in the system and continue the related
test. Otherwise, that part of test will be skipped.
4. removing glocal variable NDCTL and DAXCTL and ndctl related reset and
cleanup code from test/common.
5. removing daxctl and ndctl related test configurations in test/meson.build,
	only the 4 cxl test related configurations are kept.
6. removing Documentation/ndctl and Documentation/daxctl.
7. removing daxclt and ndctl related config options in meson.build.
8. renaming project name as `cxl-tool` and version as 1.0 in meson.build
# with all the above changes, meson setup build can pass, but cannot compile.
9. removing `ndctl/builtin.h` in util/help.c.
# After the all the above changes, both meson setup and meson compile pass.
meson test can also pass (4 cxl related tests), but there are some errors
in meson-log.txt.
10. removing ndctl and dax related configurations in contrib/meson.build.
11. removing ndctl and dax related configurations in ndctl.spec.in.
	a) dev file info in libndctl.
	b) daxctl utility dand dev file info.
	c) ndctl and daxctl conf.
	d) libdaxctl.pc and libndctl.pc configurations.
